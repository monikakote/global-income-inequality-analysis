The "Inequality in Income across the Globel" project aims to develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes income inequality data across various countries and regions. This project involves collecting, preprocessing, and structuring global income distribution and economic data to enable effective visualization. The dashboard will provide users with insights into income disparities over time, country-wise comparisons, and patterns of inequality globally. The outcome will be a user-friendly dashboard, embedded within a Streamlit web application, offering an intuitive interface for economists, researchers, policymakers, and the general public. This platform will help users explore global income inequality, understand disparities across different regions, and analyze trends in wealth distribution. The project will conclude with comprehensive testing to ensure dashboard accuracy and usability, supported by detailed documentation for future reference and enhancements.
